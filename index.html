                  Hi! My name is Erich Morris, and I am a recent graduate of Eleven Fifty Academy! It has been an incredible journey
                  to get to this point. During high school, I went to a career center called Hoosier Hills. They offered an IT program 
                  there, and this is where I first found my interest in programming. I loved it right away! Shortly after high school, 
                  I moved to Indianapolis and started the CIT program at IUPUI. There, I learned VB.NET and SQL, but ended up having 
                  a lot of trouble keeping up with some of the required courses such as accounting and arts/humanities/social science. 
                  After leaving IUPUI, I began my search of where to continue my education. I started to hear a lot about "coding bootcamps", 
                  and thought I would give the non-traditional learning experience a try, and I'm so glad that I did. 
                  I have met so many new friends, and accomplished so many goals. Eleven Fifty Academy has been
                  life changing for me. I know now that coding is what I am meant to do!

                <p>The purpose of this project was to build an ASP.NET MVC application using CSHTML, C#, CSS, and Bootstrap. The application was designed to keep track of information for a puppy breeding business such as customer, puppy, and order information. There were five tables that would communicate using foreign key properties (mother, father, puppy, customer, and order). The mother, father, and customer table were independent; where the puppy table depended on the mother and father table, and the order table depended on puppy and customer.</p>

                  <p>The purpose of this project was to build an ASP.NET API application with an Angular front end. This was a group project, which was very fun and challenging. My group and I created a food delivery app, which would keep track of restaurants, menu items, customers, and orders. Some of the most valuable skills I learned from this project were pushing to github as a team (development and feature branches), planning a project as a team, and learning how to use Angular.</p>
